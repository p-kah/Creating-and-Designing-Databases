# Creating-and-Designing-Databases

This project uses sqlite3 and pandas dataframe to transfer and create tables between SQL and Python.

In this guided project, we're going to learn how to:

1.Import data into SQLite

2.Design a normalized database schema

3.Create tables for our schema

4.Insert data into our schema

I will be working with a file of Major League Baseball games from Retrosheet. Retrosheet compiles detailed statistics on baseball games from the 1800s through to today. The main file we will be working from game_log.csv, has been produced by combining 127 separate CSV files from retrosheet. The game log has hundreds of data points on each game which we will normalize into several separate tables using SQL, providing a robust database of game-level statistics.
